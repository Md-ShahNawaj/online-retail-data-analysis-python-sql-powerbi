# Online Retail Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL + Power BI)

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data analysis project on the [Online Retail II dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii), incorporating Python for data cleaning, SQL for querying and analytics, and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The goal is to extract actionable business insights and build a clear understanding of customer behavior.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail II Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii)
- **Alternative (Cleaned)**: [Kaggle Cleaned Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahnawaj9/online-retail)
- **Content**: Transactions made by a UK-based online retailer over 2 years (2009–2011), including:
  - InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity
  - InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – Data querying and aggregation
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and business intelligence

## Key Analyses Performed

- RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Cohort Analysis (Customer retention over time)
- Sales KPIs (Revenue, Quantity, Orders)
- Time-Series Trends (Monthly/Weekly sales)
- Customer Distribution by Country
- Top Products and Revenue Drivers

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Md-ShahNawaj/online-retail-data-analysis-python-sql-powerbi.git
2. Review Python notebooks in the data_cleaning/ folder.

3. Run the SQL queries from the sql_scripts/ folder on your PostgreSQL/MySQL environment after importing the cleaned dataset.

4. Open the Power BI dashboard (when added) to explore interactive visualizations.

## Sample Visuals (Power BI) – Coming Soon
Stay tuned! Power BI report screenshots and .pbix file will be uploaded soon.
