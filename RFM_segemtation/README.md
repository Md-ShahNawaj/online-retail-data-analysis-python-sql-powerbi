# RFM Segmentation

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation is a method used by businesses to categorize customers based on their transactional behavior. This segmentation approach helps in understanding customer value and behavior, enabling targeted marketing and customer relationship management strategies.

## Why we should go through in this process

RFM segmentation involves calculating recency, frequency, and monetary scores for each customer and then categorizing them into segments based on these scores. The provided SQL script segments customers into different categories, such as 'Churned Customer', 'Slipping Away, Cannot Lose', 'New Customers', 'Potential Churners', 'Active', and 'Loyal'.
